                                   skill vs chance:  
                                   chances are the other player does not make a shot and if one  player makes the shot first then he should get a 2x bigger basket. Skill is the player should understand and develop skill of throwing the bsll in basket not outside it.
                                   adaptivity:
                                              the player will want to get more wins to get coins so that he can buy different balls.
